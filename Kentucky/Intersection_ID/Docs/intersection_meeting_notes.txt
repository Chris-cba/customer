First priority = Safety Analysis

Process
 - Create Node
 - Create NodeAsset from Nodes Table
 - Create a tool that allows a user to modify the NodeAsset
	 - Spatial Select 
		more than one node per selection
		standard ESRI select/tools
		add a unique number to attributes of selected NodeAsset
	 - Intersection Type:  Intersection, Admin Boundary, Turns Allowed


Manually populating an intersection id into the node table (in case of an addition to an existing intersection)


Build a multi-select tool to perform this automatically.



Paul to:
 - research multiselect to update asset or node attributes
 - send ppt
 - put on sharepoint site
 - send meeting invite for tue at 1:30 to start


Keith/KYTC:
 - continue to refine requirements (document)
 - determine state of network after initial intersection load
